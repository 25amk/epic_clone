# componentlevel/nodeeventwithjobs
This dataset is processed from crayextelemetry. It contains only node level sensors that are not
sampled at regular intervals, but instead emit events intermittently. It is not pivoted like the
other datasets and is in long format. Each record contains the allocation_id of the slurm job
running on the node at the time.

If you are looking for the regularly sampled node sensors such as power and temperature info, use
`componentlevel/nodetswithjobs` instead.
