# componentlevel/cduevent
This dataset doesn't exist, but may be created later.

This dataset would be processed from crayextelemetry. It would contain only cdu level sensors that
are not sampled at regular intervals, but instead emit events intermittently. It would not be
pivoted and would be in long format. 

If you are looking for the regularly sampled cdu sensors use `componentlevel/cduts` instead.
